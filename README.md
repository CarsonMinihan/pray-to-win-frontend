# moodringer-frontend

This is the frontend portion of the moodringer project I was a part of.

For this project we used Angular for the frontend, express.js for the backend, and mongoDB for the database
My team consisted of 3 people , and for the project I was the lead designer and developer for the frontend. While one of my other teammates worked on the backend and basic architecture.

this frontend won't work unless the backend is also running
